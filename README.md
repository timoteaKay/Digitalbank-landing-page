## My process

It has been a long process. I started this challenge on Tuesday 11/11/25, it is now 13/11/25 and I can say that I'm proud of the result. It has been a challenging process but I'm glad that I came through on this one with the intention to solve more challenges moving forward. I gotta say, I was in a rust before this challenge, so to me, this is sorta a getting-back-in-the-game process. Rough but Worth every second!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow later changed the architecture to Mobile-first...there is a reason why it is the recommended workflow.
- Sass pre-compiler
- Node.js
- Vanila JavaScript

### What I learned

This challenge helped me recover a lot of dormant/lost knowledge.
I struggled with running my ux.js as an external file to my index.html by using a link tag for a script file! Just Imagine the audacity! Laugh.

Also, I got to really know my limit and what I really need to work on moving forward to better hone my skills.

Learned how to include an in-line media query in this project.

```css
.nav-section {
  padding: 7rem;
  @media (min-width: 599px) and (max-width: 1200px) {
    padding: 3.5rem;
  }
  border: 2px solid yellow;
}
/* This is just an example, not derived from the real project. */
```

### Continued development

- creating better hamburger menus ...CONVENIENTLY!
- Node.js as a whole.
- Github
- More Version Control
